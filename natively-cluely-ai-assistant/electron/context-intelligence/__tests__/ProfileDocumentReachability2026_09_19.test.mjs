// Profile Intelligence reachability (2026-09-19, retrieval-scale campaign).
// Measured with experiments/retrieval-scale/run-profile.mjs — the REAL profile
// port + orchestrator + packer over a generated résumé and job description, as
// profile documents with NO file attached to the mode: the chunk that answers
// reached the prompt for 29–32% of questions (the same documents attached to a
// MODE: ~90%). Two causes, both pinned here:
//
//   1. A document lookup (DOCUMENT_FACT) retrieves from reference-file pools
//      only — a deliberate narrowing that stops a value lookup being flooded by
//      résumé chunks. With no reference file it searches NOTHING, and the job
//      description was planned only when the question said "role", "position"
//      or "interview": 37 of 45 job-description questions could not reach it.
//   2. The port's lossless raw text was bare ~110-word windows with no heading:
//      "Worked with 7 engineers under …" never said WHICH project.
//
// After: 85–86% (markdown text), 74–86% (plain text, as a PDF extracts).
