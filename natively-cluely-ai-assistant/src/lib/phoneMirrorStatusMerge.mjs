/**
 * Fold a `phone-mirror:status` broadcast into the Settings pane's PhoneMirrorInfo
 * (pure, unit-tested, platform-agnostic).
 *
 * Extracted from PhoneMirrorSettings' onPhoneMirrorStatus handler on 2026-09-22
 * after "Allow LAN access → confirm → toggle snaps back OFF and the Enable row
 * reads 'port undefined · bound to undefined (loopback only)'".
 *
 * The launcher window deliberately receives only the small flag subset of a
 * status broadcast — { running, enabled, clients, extensionConnected } — see the
 * onStatusChange listener in electron/ipcHandlers.ts (large payloads into a
 * software-composited Windows launcher hurt paint). PhoneMirrorSettings is
 * mounted INSIDE the launcher (SettingsOverlay) and holds the full snapshot it
 * got from get-info / the enable / set-lan reply. Treating every broadcast as a
 * full snapshot replaced that object wholesale, so port / bindAddress /
 * exposeOnLan / URLs / tokens became undefined ~150 ms (the service's status
 * debounce) after the IPC reply had painted the right values.
 *
 * Rules:
 *  - full snapshot → same short-circuit as before: identical qr / url / tokens /
 *    running / clients / extensionConnected keeps `prev` (React skips the
 *    render); anything else replaces the state with the snapshot.
 *  - partial (flag subset) → only the known flags it actually carries are laid
 *    over `prev`; nothing else is touched. Same object back when none changed.
 *    Callers should follow a partial payload with a get-info refetch: the
 *    subset cannot describe a restart (new port / bind host / URLs).
