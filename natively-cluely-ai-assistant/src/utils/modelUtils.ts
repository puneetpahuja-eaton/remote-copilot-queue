 *      dropped from the ID; it just has no business being on screen.
 *   2. `<upstream>/` — the PROXY's own model id. Most LiteLLM configs name
 *      models `openai/gpt-4o`, `anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet`, `bedrock/...`,
 *      so a raw id reads `litellm/openai/gpt-4o`.

 * The label is therefore the LAST segment. Accepts prefixed and bare ids
 * alike, because the two callers hold different forms: the picker and the
 * allow-list hold `litellm/<id>`, while the discovery cache
 * (getAvailableLiteLLMModels) holds the proxy's `<id>` verbatim.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT prettifyModelId(): that is built for our own hyphenated
 * ids and mangles proxy ids — `bedrock/anthropic.claude-v2` came out as
 * "Bedrock/Anthropic.Claude V2". A proxy model id is a literal the user typed
 * into their own config, so it renders verbatim.
 *
 * KNOWN, ACCEPTED: two upstreams can expose the same model name, so
 * `openai/gpt-4o` and `azure/gpt-4o` both label as "gpt-4o" and are
 * indistinguishable in a list. Showing the bare name was chosen with that
